# Volume Booster Without Dementia
Have you ever had that problem where a volume booster extension would just forget what volume did you set it to on a page? No? Well, I have. And it's annoying. So I made this extension to fix that problem.

It's a simple extension that allows you to boost the volume (max. 500%) of any page and will (thankfully) remember the volume you set it to. It has two sliders: a global one and a per-domain one. You can delete the per-domain volume by clicking the trash can icon next to the slider. In that case, this extension will use the global slider.
